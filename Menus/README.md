<h2>Menus Prototype</h2>

At present, the prototype incorporates the names and prices of a very small selection of menu items for two food chains. 
I hope to transform this into an app that will take an array of menu items from a much larger selection of food chain 
restaurants (50+) and order them based on several properties (price, calorie count, sugar/sodium levels, etc.). 

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
I've manually inputted the names and prices of each menu item. 
I realize, however, that this is highly ineffective for what I want to accomplish. My next steps are to figure out how 
I can automate this process to extract all the necessary data from publicly available sources. I've done some research, 
and it will likely involve the use of a web crawling tool or APIs - both of which I currently know extremely little to 
nothing about.
