**Overview**
--------
This repo contains an assortment of mini projects coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a good way for me to keep track of my progress as I continue to learn and experiment with code. I plan to add greater functionality to these projects as I grow in my understanding and proficiency in these programming languages.
