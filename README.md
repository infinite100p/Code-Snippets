**Overview**
--------
This repo contains a collection of random mini projects coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I find that this is a great way for me to keep track of my progress as I continue to learn and experiment with code. I plan to add greater functionality to these projects as I grow in my understanding and proficiency in these programming languages.

**Goals**
--------------

**Menus Project**: 

At present, the prototype incorporates the names and prices of a very small selection of menu items for two food chains. I hope to transform this into an app that will take an array of menu items from a much larger selection of food chain restaurants (50+) and order them based on several properties (price, calorie count, sugar/sodium levels, etc.). In my HTML file, I have manually inputted the names and prices of each menu item. I realize, however, that this is highly ineffective for what I want to accomplish. 

My next steps are to figure out how I can automate this process to extract all the necessary data from publicly available sources. I've done some research, and it will likely involve the use of a web crawling tool or APIs  - both of which I currently know extremely little to nothing about. Ideally, relying on APIs alone will be sufficient as web crawling seems to fall in a gray area which I'd rather not get into due to possible legal and ethical implications.
